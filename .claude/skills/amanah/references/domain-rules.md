## 1. Money

- Unit: **kobo**, integer. ₦1 = 100 kobo. ₦500,000 = `50_000_000`.
- API fields are kobo integers (`targetAmount`, `raisedAmount`, `availableAmount`). Zod schema: `z.number().int().nonnegative()`.
- Display: `formatNaira(kobo)` → `₦500,000` (whole) or `₦1,500.50`.
- Input: `parseNairaToKobo(text)` → kobo or `null`. Accepts `1500`, `1,500`, `₦1,500.50`; rejects anything else.
- Progress: `progressPercent(raised, target)` → floored, clamped integer 0–100.
- Item totals: `total_cost = quantity × unit_cost` (integers). **Sum of item totals must equal `target_amount`.**
- Derived values on the accountability page:
  - Remaining to raise = `target − raised`
  - Spent = Σ expenses
  - Balance held = `raised − spent`
  - Progress = `raised / target`
- Total expenses can never exceed `raised`.

## 2. The donation cap (spec §4)

The organisation may never receive more than its target.

- `available = target − raised − active reservations`. The API returns it as `availableAmount`; the frontend never recomputes it from stale data.
- Checkout creates a **reservation** (default TTL 15 min, D6) inside a locked DB transaction; the reservation ID is the payment reference.
- Over-remaining (D1 default: **offer the remaining amount**): API returns `409 AMOUNT_EXCEEDS_AVAILABLE` with `availableAmount` → UI offers "Give ₦X instead" / Cancel.
- `409 TARGET_REACHED` when `available == 0`; `409 CAMPAIGN_NOT_ACCEPTING` when not LIVE.
- Confirmation only via verified webhook. The result page polls `GET /api/donations/:reference` and **never claims success before the backend confirms**.
- Late payment beyond target → `ExcessRecord` (PENDING_RETURN → RETURNED or SENT_TO_BAYT_AL_MAL), handled manually by a platform admin.

### Donate panel UI states (exact)

| Condition                              | Button                   | Copy                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `available > 0` and status LIVE        | Enabled, shows remaining | "₦X remaining"                                                 |
| `available == 0` and `raised < target` | Disabled                 | "Target nearly reached. Pending payments are being processed." |
| status FUNDED                          | Disabled permanently     | "Target reached. Donations closed."                            |
| CLOSED / COMPLETED / not LIVE          | Disabled                 | Status-appropriate message                                     |
| Offline                                | Disabled                 | Offline explanation                                            |

## 3. Campaign lifecycle (spec §5)

```
DRAFT → PENDING_REVIEW → LIVE → FUNDED (automatic at target) → COMPLETED
              ↓            ↓
          REJECTED       CLOSED (org ends early / end date) → COMPLETED
              ↓
            DRAFT
```

- Only `LIVE` accepts donations.
- Expenses, evidence and witness confirmations allowed in `LIVE`, `FUNDED`, `CLOSED`.
- `target_amount` is **immutable after the first donation** (and title/purpose/items too if D8 purpose lock is approved — not yet).
- Only a `VERIFIED` organisation can submit a campaign.
- The UI only offers transitions the diagram allows for the current role.

## 4. Roles and access (spec §3)

| Role                           | Area         | Can                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Donor (guest, no account — D7) | public       | browse, donate, view accountability                                                   |
| `ORG_ADMIN`                    | `/org/*`     | own organisation only: campaigns, expenses, evidence, updates, witnesses, close early |
| `WITNESS`                      | `/witness/*` | assigned campaigns only: confirm or dispute delivery                                  |
| `PLATFORM_ADMIN`               | `/admin/*`   | verify orgs, review campaigns, resolve excess, read audit log                         |

- A witness **cannot** be an admin of the organisation running the campaign (`409 WITNESS_CONFLICT`).
- Protected pages render no data before the session is confirmed; wrong role → 403 page.
- Tokens/sessions never in localStorage.

## 5. Evidence and witnesses (spec §7)

- Capture with `<input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="environment">` + Geolocation API; record client capture time.
- **Server upload time is authoritative** — label it as such in the UI; show client time only as secondary.
- Compress client-side (≈1600px long edge, < 400 KB) before upload; slow networks are the norm.
- Location denied is allowed — show "location unavailable", don't block.
- Honest limitation: a browser can't prove a photo came from the camera. Trust signal = location + server timestamp + witness confirmation. Never claim more in copy.
- A **disputed** item can never be shown or marked as delivered. Dispute requires a comment.

## 6. Privacy (spec §9, Nigeria Data Protection Act)

- Collect only name, email, phone at checkout.
- Public pages and public API responses never include donor email or phone.
- Anonymous giving toggle only if D8 approves it.

## 7. Copy and terminology

- British spelling ("organisation", "colour"); Nigerian context (₦, `en-NG`, Africa/Lagos time).
- Tone: calm, dignified, plain. Trust is earned by precision, not superlatives. No guilt-tripping donors, no exaggerated impact claims.
- Never: zakat, zakah, waqf, awqaf (out of scope permanently).
- Islamic terms already in the spec: Amanah, Sharia, riba, Bayt al-Mal (excess handling). Confirm with the team before introducing any other religious terminology.

## 8. Open decisions (spec §11) — defaults in use

| D8  | Purpose lock, no riba, permissible purposes, anonymous giving | **None** until approved — don't build them         |
| D9  | Scholarly advisor / excess ruling                             | Placeholder                                        |
| D10 | End dates                                                     | Optional                                           |
| D11 | Email receipts                                                | Placeholder — on-screen receipt is always required |

Changing any default needs the user's decision and an ADR.
