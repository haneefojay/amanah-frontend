# Architecture Decision Records

Every significant decision about Amanah (technology, architecture, process, or how a spec open decision was resolved) is recorded here as an ADR. ADRs are **append-only history**: never rewrite an accepted ADR. To change a decision, write a new ADR that supersedes the old one and update the old one's status to `Superseded by ADR-XXX`.

## How to add an ADR

1. Copy [`TEMPLATE.md`](./TEMPLATE.md) to `ADR-XXX-short-kebab-title.md`, using the next number (three digits, never reused).
2. Fill in every section. **Options considered** must list at least two real options with pros and cons.
3. Set the status to `Proposed` while it awaits the team, or `Accepted` once decided. Always include the decision date.
4. Add a row to the index above. Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.
5. If the decision changes roadmap scope, update `docs/roadmap/ROADMAP_INDEX.md`.

## Status values

`Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Rejected`, `Deprecated`, or `Superseded by ADR-XXX`.
