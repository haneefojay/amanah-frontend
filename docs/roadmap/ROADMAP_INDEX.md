# Roadmap Index

**This is the single source of truth for roadmap status.** The roadmap files describe _what_ to build and _when it counts as done_. This file records _where we are_. Every agent and contributor reads this file first and updates it last.

| File                                           | Contents                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |

| [BACKEND_ROADMAP.md](./BACKEND_ROADMAP.md)     | Phases `B0` to `B12`: the API service (stack pending, ADR-004) |
| [../amanah-mvp-spec.md](../amanah-mvp-spec.md) | The product specification both roadmaps are derived from       |

## 1. How to use the roadmaps (agent workflow)

1. **Orient.** Read `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`, then this file's sections 2 (Current focus) and 4 (Status board).
2. **Pick work.** Take the highest-priority item that is `Not started` and whose dependencies are `Done` or `Done (mocked)`. Order of preference:
   - P0 before P1 before P2;
   - items in the current milestone (section 3) first;
   - backend items that unblock the most P0 frontend items.

   Never start an item that is `Blocked`. Never start P2 while any P0 in the current milestone is open.

3. **Claim it.** Set its status to `In progress`, put your name or agent ID in **Owner**, and set **Updated** to today.
4. **Read the full entry** in the roadmap file: scope, backend dependency, tests and Definition of Done. Read the relevant spec section.
5. **Build test-first where practical.** Write the tests listed in the entry, then the code. Meet the **Global Definition of Done** plus the item's own Definition of Done.
6. **Finish.** Set the status to `Done` (or `Done (mocked)` for frontend items whose backend isn't integrated yet). Add the PR or commit link in **Notes**, add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, and update section 2.
7. **When blocked:** set `Blocked`, write the reason in **Notes**, add it to section 5 (Blockers) and tell the user.
8. **When a decision is needed:** don't guess on anything that is hard to reverse. Record the options in a new ADR with status `Proposed` and ask the user.
9. **Scope changes:** never renumber. Add new items with the next free ID in the right phase, and mark removed items `Dropped` with a reason.

### Status values

| Status          | Meaning                                                                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Not started`   | Not yet picked up                                                                             |
| `In progress`   | Claimed. Someone is working on it                                                             |
| `Done (mocked)` | Frontend only: meets its Definition of Done against the MSW mock. Backend integration pending |
| `Done`          | Meets the global and item Definition of Done, integrated and tested                           |
| `Blocked`       | Cannot proceed. The reason is in Notes and section 5                                          |
| `Dropped`       | Removed from scope. The reason is in Notes                                                    |

## 2. Current focus

- **Now:** F1, F2.1 to F2.4 and all of F3 (accountability section) are done against mocks, which meets M1's frontend exit criteria. Next: F4 (checkout) against mocks. F0.6: deployed at amanah-frontend-beta.vercel.app; set `ENABLE_MOCK_API=1` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` on Vercel so `/campaigns` loads. B0.1 (backend stack decision, ADR-004) is waiting on the team.
- **Next:** F4 (donation checkout) against mocks; F3 integrates with the backend in M3 (B5.2, B5.3, B8.2, B8.3, B9.2, B9.3).
- **Decisions needed from the team:** ADR-004 (backend stack), spec open decisions D8, D9 and D11, the convention date, and the pilot organisation.
